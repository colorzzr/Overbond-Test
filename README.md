Problem requires to analysis the corperate bond and govornment bond

I decide to use the golang to provide solution

## structure

```
type infoBond
```

## API document

`func loadData(string scvFileName) infoBond infoBond`

 - this function would scan the target string and return two array for corperate and government each. the array would be sorted for further usage

 - Error control: fatal when cannot open file
